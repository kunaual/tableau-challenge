# tableau-challenge

In this challenge I studied 4 years of April data of citibike usage in Jersey City.   Selected 1 month per year to limit the volume of data in order to stay within the limits of the free version of tableau.


### 4 Years of April Citibike Trip Counts
##### Total Trip Counts
In the barchart visualizations, you can see that citibike trips were increasing 2018 to 2019.  2020 Covid pandemic greatly affected citibike usage.  2020 has less than 30% of the trip volume of 2019.  In 2021, April trip count has come back to 2018 levels.
##### Customer vs Subscriber Counts
Viewing the trip counts of Customers vs Subscribers, can see over 90% of the trips were taken by subscribers. 
93% of trips in 2018 were by subscribers.
91% of trips in 2019 were by subscribers.
While 2021 April total count of trips has returned to 2018 levels, the subscriber count is way down.
4% of trips in 2021 were by subscribers.
